Master Server
-------------

##Credentials:
user: root
pass: changeme

user: master
pass: changeme


To change passwords log in as a particular user and type 'passwd'. The 
master user has full 'sudo' rights to this system. Instead of logging
into the system as root, ssh  into master as the master user and become
root by executing 'sudo -i'

	ssh master@192.168.122.1
	sudo -i

## Network Configuration:
NIC 1 is the interface for the DHCP server and should be plugged into the same
switch/vlan as the clients.

IP: 192.168.122.1
NETMASK: 255.255.255.0

NIC 2 is set to DHCP and could be used as the master server managment interface.
